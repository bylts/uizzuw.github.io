title: Stop turning yourself into a walking battery!
---

I was coming home from work today when I realised I forgot to charge my phone. I quickly reach into my pocket and connect it to my external battery. Shame, I just wanted to listen to some music.

But wait, now that I think about it, this morning I wanted to do the same, but my headphones' battery was low. Oh well, now everything's charged and I can keep on living,

Or is it!? I just got home and my wireless keyboard is completely drained as well. And would you look at this, my phone died as well because I didn't fully charge my external battery.

Can you imagine the sort of hell we would get into if we kept on going like this? Just think about adding perhaps a laptop, a tablet and a smartwatch to the equation. Or even more stuff!

Just when have we become so dependent on portable electricity? We've undergone such an intense "going mobile" mutation during the past few years, it's insane! In 2010 all I had to charge was my phone. ONCE A WEEK.

Is this advisable, though? Surrounding yourself with lots of energy maggots that keep bugging you all the time? I personally don't think so. Portability is a good thing, but only if controlled, and definitely not if being controlled by. I can understand the need to work on the go, or keep up with the latest buzzing alerts that matter in your life, but be very picky about the alerts that you consider as such. Don't just let anything enter your workflow. You don't let toxic substances infiltrate your system on a daily basis, right!?

Your phone should be the only "smart companion" you should be carrying around with you. And it should be well-educated. Let's perhaps add some wireless headphones for the active audiophiles around, but that's about it. I don't see any particular need for a smartwatch, or any other device of that sort. It's your responsibility to consciously consume technology, not the other way around.

All these buzzing notifications are creating a world of incredibly short attention-spanned zombies with no ability to concentrate at all on complex matters. You know that annoying friend that keeps bugging you every 5 minutes when you're trying to marathon Star Wars? That's exactly what's happening to you every day, except that it's not a friend, it's some crap service you think you need for some hipstery reason, when in reality, you've lived your entire life just fine before starting to use it, and you don't see any REAL benefit to using it.

And it doesn't seem like we're going to get any game-changing battery life improvements on the consumer market anytime soon - why would we, when we're such a good milk source for all these companies who keep selling us bullshit about "MASSIVE IMPROVEMENTS" in their "BEWEST FLAGSHIP" products.

Auto-control. Learn that. It's not like it's a programming language, you should have the attention span to at least start to understand how it works and its usefulness.
