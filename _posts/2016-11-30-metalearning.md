title: The power and importance of metalearning

Long time no blogging, eh?

It's been two months since I've published the last article here. It seems that I cannot bring myself to become that savage blogger version of myself I keep fantasizing about. All hipsters do it! Am I not hipster enough? Or perhaps not enough things to blog about? Nah, not that... Oh, I know! Time.

It's a little bit tricky to also keep blogging on a frequent basis when you're running a full-time job, full-time university, while also working on individual projects, both in IT and in music production. Oh, yeah, and caring about the loved ones and all that, sure.

I am currently at an age at which I have a very bright, optimisting and promissing perspective on life. There are so many opportunities to do so many things! The temptation to do as much as you can and more, to push your limits every day, to aspire to be better and better, is just way too tasty right now. Of course, while not overdoing yourself - that's bad. You **must** find balance in life, not at some point, but at as many points as you can.

Being involved in so many activities also means learning alot of new things. Mostly technical, but not necessarely. I am lucky enough that the factors revolving around my everyday life also have a quite benefic emotional, perhaps even charisma-altering inpact. For example, while work has pretty much been university on steroids for my technical skills, it had also helped me improve my soft skills alot. Being exposed to certain critical situations, finding them challenging, and even beating some of them (albeit not necessary), does shape you in many ways, ways wich I fortunately find more good than bad.

*But how the bloody squiggity-squiggle are you able to learn all of that, you overconfident four-eyed weasel?*

I had a period when I was asking myself that, seeing how everyone around me was failing hard at it. I could read it on people's faces - they were way overwhelmed with the same information that I was calmly and swiftly processing at the time. How could I do that? Could I be some kind of evil genius alien with some huge inhuman brain? Perhaps. But I wasn't the only one. There were also people keeping up with me, if not doing even better. And we were talking no secret mother tongue among us, so I have ruled out the possibility of extraterestrialism. And so the second answer I came up is metalearning.

**Metalearning** refers to the process one level above from simple learning - specifically *learning about learning*. According to Donald B. Maudsley, metalearning is *"the process by which learners become aware of and increasingly in control of habits of perception, inquiry, learning, and growth that they have internalized"*.

In simpler terms, metalearnings means understanding how you learn best, in what way you prefer the information to be given to you, in terms of both transfer medium (paper, video, live dialogue etc) and structure (lots of small, organised bits vs one well-defined chunk etc), when and where you are the most learning-oriented mindset, and all other behavioural and cognitive factors of the kind. Understanding your learning process is key to refining it.

Once you become aware of your learning process, you can start influencing the factors that used to influence it. For example, you are able to work on the scheduling of your learning, its aggregation and structure, or you could even direct the person that is teaching you towards *your* way of understanding things, so he knows which concepts he should describe stuff further to you.

To some, all this might seem trivial. Some may already be doing it and arguing it doesn't really help. I think it's as important, if not even more, as the learning itself. You may not realise it, but you are probably often doing compromises while learning, not always trying to understand the deep meaning behind things, or what specific notion made that particular concept tick in your head. In order to acieve a well-defined metalearning process, you must tahe **everything** into consideration. At first it may seem troublesome, because it will not be that rewarding from the start. However, its usefulness will be exponentially growing as you will become more and more skilled in it. That is why people who have done metalearning from an earlier step are able to learn a lot more things in a much shorter timespan.

There is one more crazy thing you can do with metalearning - **take it to an infinite recursive cycle**. Learn about your metalearning and refine it. Do meta-metalearning, perhaps even meta-meta-metalear~ you get the idea. Being able to single out problems through abstraction by looking from one level up is very helpful when refining that process. Knowing when to do that, though, comes from experience.

So as you can see, metalearning is a topic that can be expanded and talked about from many angles and to a great extent. But don't forget the reason we are talking about it is to figure out how to use it in order to improve your learning process. And while you could read countless long and boring blog posts about it, just like this one, the best experience comes from practicing it. So do it! Next time your teacher explains something his way and you don't understand it properly, try teaching him a thing or two about yourself and *your* learning process.
