title: Common Core for the Common Man - A different way of looking at mathematics
---

While I was messing around on the interwebs, watching some Programming-related content, I came across the following video in the comments. Surprisingly, I have never heard of the concept before, or rather of its name. Hell - I wasn't even watching this to understand it, but some guy pointed out "Reason #4" to some other guy in the comments of another video, I found the idea interesting and then I started digging in.

Anyways, no more talk. Please watch the current video and then come back so we shall properly proceed.

So after I've watched this entire theories-spitting session, some of which I found interesting while others were rather laughable at, I decided to dwell into the fantasy world of the comments. Once again, I invite you to do the same. Beware the huge pile of idiocy, though.

So let's take a step back and analyze what this "Common Core" is. Quoting Wikipedia :

<i>The Common Core State Standards Initiative is an educational initiative in the United States that details what Kâ€“12 students should know in English language arts and mathematics at the end of each grade. The initiative is sponsored by the National Governors Association (NGA) and the Council of Chief State School Officers (CCSSO) and seeks to establish consistent educational standards across the states as well as ensure that students graduating from high school are prepared to enter credit-bearing courses at two- or four-year college programs or to enter the workforce</i> and this and that and bla bla bla.

I'm sorry but you had to go through reading all this for reasons that I'll explain a little bit later. Now, as the title says, I'm going to give you the common man's approach :

Common Core maths is a different, broader way of thinking about maths (or at least that's what they claim they are) . The general idea here is to be able to "solve for all, not for one", to see maths as a LEARNING subject and not a COMPETITIVE one . They state that children must not be encouraged to solve small, speciffic problems fast, but rather be able to think about the deeper meaning behind them more and be able to explain how things, for example numbers, work behind the scenes.

I'll go through this step by step.

I agree with the idea of having a deeper understanding of things. Any good programmer or mathematician knows what I'm talking about. It's one thing to solve one particular case, and a completely other thing to be able to solve ANY situation that randomly gets thrown at you from that same sphere of issues.

They are also pushing for the use of more laborious, yet easier to understand algorithms for simple operations, this again for the same idea of deeper understanding. Let me give you an example.

Solve 23 + 59 .

How did you do it? You added 3+9 and kept 1, then added 2+5, + that 1 you kept.

Here's how they do it in CC :

23 + 59 = 20 + 60 + 3 - 1 = 80 + 2 = 82

They round to the nearest ten and add or subtract the extra bits afterwards, in order to get rid of that 1 you have to keep.

Here's another example : 452 - 127.

How did you do it? You took 1 from 5 and subtracted 7 from 12 and so on.

In CC they use the idea of a numbers axis to show the difference between two numbers as the distance between two points :

------[127]-------[200]--------------[300]-------------[400]--------[452]------------

Or using the stairs :

127
 +2  
\__________  
130
+70  
\__________  
 200
+200  
\__________  
400
+50  
\__________  
450
 +2  
\__________  
452

and then add all the +-es.

There are mixed feelings here. Looking at the extremes, some argue hands down that children <i>must practice the old way of calculating stuff until they bleed</i>, while others argue that <i>it's not worth much if you can do quick maths if you don't realise how it works in order to do more complexe operations</i> . While I agree that the CC way does shed some light on the works of the wonderful number system, the old system must still be taught and repeated the most. Why? Because not all children will become math geeks in their lives. Some of them won't give a crap about how numbers <i>actually</i> work and will find it rather frustrating to understand it, when all they need is just a quick solution to a quite frequently-repeating question.

Here's something to tkink about - do you know how chinese children are taught to multiply? Here's a video :

Right, now onto the real issue. DOES THE GOVERNMENT WANT TO BRAINWASH CHILDREN!?
Probably not. But what they seem to be doing is breed and or hunt down geniuses. Silicon Valley is often mentioned in the video. There is a thirst in the educational system (and up) for having lots of smart people do smart stuff. And they don't even care if they sometimes go to lengths that resemble the works of natural selection in order to achieve this.

**Education is not about survival of the fittest. Education is about solving a problem for all, not for one.**

The problem is not CC math itself, but the context in which it is used. CC math is a good tool to scout out potentially brilliant future mathematicians, if used right, but it is not ready to be the standard yet. While some of its ideologies can be symbiotically injected into regular math, we must do this in the context of our present, and it is IMPERATIVE that we keep this context realistic.  Education, above all, should be the foundation on which future generations develop. Many people frankly don't realise its enormous importance and just play lab-rat with it. We must not allow this. No matter the country, no matter the leader.

To sum it up, CC math as a mathematical ideology is indeed interesting and has many benefits, but it must be implemented in a selective and smart way. As for a politico-economical ideology, however, it can prove to be way more toxic for our future generations than some people anticipate.
